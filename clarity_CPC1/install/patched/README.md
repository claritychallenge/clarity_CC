# Metadata for upgrading from data release v1 to v1_1

If you have previously downloaded and installed the earlier clarity_CPC1_data.v1.tgz and do not wish to download the newer clarity_CPC1_data.v1_1.tgz, you can update your data by simply copying the files in this directory to the location where you installed the earlier version, i.e. from this directory,

```bash
cp * ../..data/clarity_data/metadata
```

The rest of the data in v1 is identical to that in v1_1.
